            <p>This project was the first flushed out webpage we made. It was designed to give us a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and how we upload our code to GitHub as well as introducing branching.</p>

          <p>This project was a blog post/website about how great of a vacation destination Cabo San Lucas is. It introduced me and my partner to Bootstrap and the many ways you can use it to customize your page.</p>

        <h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
        <div class="well">

          <p>I was born in Ventura, California and moved up to Portland when I was only 7 years old and have been here ever since. I graduated from Tigard High School in 2016 and wend on to Portland Community College for my Associates Degree. I have been working since I was 16, mostly in food service and cooking. I am currently a cook at the Tualatin location of New Seasons Market.</p>

          <p>Some of my hobbies include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Literature</li>
            <li>Politics</li>
            <li>Clothing</li>
            <li>Cooking</li>
            <li>Bouldering, Hiking, <em>being outdoors!</em></li>
          </ul>

          <p>I've decided to take a class at Epicodus because I am always interested in learning a new skill and I wanted to see if programming is something I am interested in/good at. I am also interested in the possibilty of pursuing a career in web development or design. </p>
