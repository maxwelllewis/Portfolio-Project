    <p>Welcome to my programming portfolio! My name is Maxwell Briles and I am taking an Intro to Programming class at Epicodus and wanted to show off what I have done so far as well as tell you about myself.</p>

    <h2>List of Projects Completed</h2>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/maxwelllewis/hello-world">Hello-World Project</a></h3>

    <p>This project was the first and very simply gave us some code that we used to learn how to push our code to GitHub.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/maxwelllewis/My-First-Webpage">My-First-Webpage Project</a></h3>

    <p>This project was the first flushed out webpage. It was designed to give us a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and how we upload our code to GitHub as well as introducing branching.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/maxwelllewis/dream-vacation">Dream-Vacation Project</a></h3>

    <p>This project was a blog post/website about how great of a vacation destination Cabo San Lucas is. It introduced me and my partner to Bootstrap and the many ways you can use it to customize your page.</p>
